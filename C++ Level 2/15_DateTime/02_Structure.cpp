============================
ðŸ“Œ Summary:
============================
- `localtime(&t)` converts a `time_t` value into a `tm` structure representing local time.
- You can then access specific parts like year, month, hour, etc.
- Note:
   - `tm_year` is years since 1900 â†’ so add 1900.
   - `tm_mon` is months since January â†’ so add 1.
   - `tm_wday` gives you the weekday (0=Sunday).
   - `tm_isdst` tells if daylight saving time is in effect.

Useful for formatting or customizing how date/time is presented.
