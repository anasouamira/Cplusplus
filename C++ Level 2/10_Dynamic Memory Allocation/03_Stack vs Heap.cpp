/*
==============================
ðŸ“š Explanation: Stack vs Heap
==============================

1. Stack:
   - Used for static memory allocation.
   - Variables are automatically created and destroyed.
   - Memory is managed by the system (compiler).
   - Very fast and safe, but limited in size.

2. Heap:
   - Used for dynamic memory allocation.
   - Memory is manually allocated using 'new' and must be freed using 'delete'.
   - Gives control over memory lifetime and size.
   - Risk of memory leaks and fragmentation if not managed properly.

ðŸ§¾ Summary of Differences (Stack vs Heap in C++)
=================================================

| Aspect            | Stack                         | Heap                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Allocation        | Automatic (compiler)          | Manual (programmer)           |
| Deallocation      | Automatic                     | Manual using 'delete'         |
| Speed             | Faster                        | Slower                        |
| Lifetime          | Ends with function/block      | Until deleted manually        |
| Memory Size       | Limited                       | Large                         |
| Errors            | Stack overflow (rare)         | Memory leaks (common)         |
| Use Case          | Local variables               | Dynamic data, objects         |
